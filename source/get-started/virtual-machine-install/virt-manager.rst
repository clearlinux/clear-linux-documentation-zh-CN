|CL-ATTR| using virt-manager
############################

This page explains how to create a |CL-ATTR| virtual machine using the
`virt-mgr`_ desktop application with |CL| as the guest operating system.
These instructions support the |CL| live-server installer to create the |CL|
:abbr:`VM (Virtual Machine)`.

Prerequisites
*************

#. Enable virtualization, such as `Intel® Virtualization Technology <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/virtualization/virtualization-technology/intel-virtualization-technology.html>`_
   (Intel® VT), on the host system from the UEFI firmware setup.

#. Install the software bundles kvm-host and virt-manager-gui using 
   :command:`swupd`:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo swupd bundle-add kvm-host virt-manager-gui

#. Add your userid to the `kvm` and `libvirt` groups.
   
   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo usermod -G kvm -a $USER
      sudo usermod -G libvirt -a $USER

#. Enable the `libvirtd` daemon and then reboot the system to complete the 
   process.

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo systemctl enable libvirtd
      sudo reboot

   This will add your userid to the specified groups and start the libvirtd 
   daemon after the system has rebooted.

Download the |CL| installer ISO
*******************************

There are several options available to set up and use a |CL| VM with
:command:`virt-manager`. You can either download the `KVM` image and run it as
is or download the installer ISO and run it to create a new installation of
|CL|.

This example uses the live-server-installer ISO to create a new installation.

#. Download the `Clear Linux* OS Server` from the `Downloads`_ page. I used
   Firefox and downloaded it to my `~/Downloads` directory.

#. (Optional) Validate the integrity of the downloaded image by checking the
   file hash and signatures. Refer to :ref:`validate-signatures` for detailed
   steps.

Next, we'll set up the virt-manager and load the ISO from this section. 

Launch and setup virt-manager
*****************************

Virt-manager is a GUI-based virtual machine manager that runs in your desktop environment. We use the Gnome desktop and launch the Virtual Machine Manager from the applications window. You will see the
following application window:

   :alt: Virtual Machine Manager

   Figure 1: Virtual Machine Manager

In the `Name` window of the application, select and highlight the `QEMU/KVM`
item and then select Edit > Connection Details. You will see the dialog box
showing the `QEMU/KVM Connection Details`.

.. figure:: figures/virtmgr/virt-manager-02.png
   :scale: 100%
   :alt: QEMU/KVM Connection Details

   Figure 2: QEMU/KVM Connection Details

On the `Overview` tab, make sure the `Autoconnect` field is checked. Select 
the
`Virtual Networks` tab and at the lower left of the dialog window, select the 
:guilabel:`+` key to add a new network connection. The 
`Create a new virtual network` dialog window will open as shown in figure 3:

.. figure:: figures/virtmgr/virt-manager-03.png

   Figure 3: Create a new virtual network

To accept the default values as shown in the figure above, select the 
:guilabel:`Finish` button to create your virtual network.

Now that you have created your virtual network, you can close the 
`QEMU/KVM Connection details` dialog box and return to the Virtual
Machine Manager main console. You are ready to create your VM.

Create a new virt-manager virtual machine
*****************************************

To create a new VM you can either select `file > New Virtual Machine` or click 
on the `Create a new virtual machine` icon on the left side of the ribbon. 
This will launch the `New VM` dialog box, shown in figure 4 below.

.. figure:: figures/virtmgr/virt-manager-04.png
   :scale: 100%
   :alt: New VM

   Figure 4: New VM dialog box

#. Select the `Local install media (ISO image or CDROM)` and then select the
   :guilabel:`Forward` button.

#. This will bring you to step 2 of the wizard where you can choose ISO or 
   CDROM install media. 

   #. Before browsing for the ISO image, un-check the 
      `Automatically detect from the installation media / source` field and
      then select the :guilabel:`Browse...` button as shown in figure 5

         Figure 5: New VM dialog box

   #. In the `Choose Storage Volume` dialog, select the
      :guilabel:`Browse Local` button as shown in figure 6, find and select 
      the ISO image that you downloaded earlier and open it.

         Figure 6: Choose storage volume dialog box

   #. In the `Choose the operating system you are installing` search field, 
      begin typing `generic` until you see the `Generic default` value and 
      then select that. Once finished on this screen, select the
      :guilabel:`Forward` as shown in figure 7.

      .. note::

         You may get a message that the emulator may not have search
         permissions for the path you entered for the ISO image and it will 
         want to correct that.  Select :guilabel:`Yes` to proceed to the next
         step.

#. In step 3 of the `New VM` wizard you set the memory and CPUs to allocate 
   for your new VM. Depending on the resources available to you on your host
   system, select what is appropriate. In this example I set `Memory` to
   2048GB and `CPUs` to 1. Once complete, select the :guilabel:`Forward` as 
   shown in figure 8, to go to the next step.

#. Step 4 of the `New VM` wizard will set up your storage media for your VM.
   You can create a new disk image or select to use an existing image. For
   this exercise we select the `Enable storage for this virtual machine` and
   create a 20GB image to go with. Once set as shown in figure 9, select the
   :guilabel:`Forward` button.

#. Step 5 of the wizard will show you the selections you have made and give
   you the ability to customize the configuration before running the
   installation. Select the `Customize configuration before install` check-box
   and then select the :guilabel:`Finish` button.

#. Clear Linux requires an UEFI firmware to boot and operate correctly so you
   need to customize the installation process by changing the firmware from
   `BIOS` to `UEFI x86_64`. In the `Firmware` field, select the
   `UEFI x86_64: /usr/share/qemu/OVMF.fd` entry as shown in figure 11 and 
   select the :guilabel:`Apply` button.

#. Begin the installation by selecting the :guilabel:`Begin Installation` in
   the upper left hand corner of the `vm1 on QEMU/KVM` dialog box.

Install |CL| on the virt-manager VM
***********************************

To install |CL| in your VM, follow the instructions in the getting started
guide :ref:`bare-metal-install-server`. 

.. note::
   You already have the ISO image downloaded and connected to your VM and 
   your network will show up as a wired connection so you do not need to set
   up the network as described in the installation guide.

Congratulations! You have successfully installed |CL| in your new VM and can
begin using it immediately. The `virt-manager` tool is maintained on GitHub
at `virt-manager-github`_.
